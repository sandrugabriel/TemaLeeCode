        /*You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and so on.

You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.

Return an array result of length 2 where:

result[0] is the total number of lines.
result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.


Example 1:

Output: [3,60]
Explanation: You can write s as follows:
abcdefghij  // 100 pixels wide
klmnopqrst  // 100 pixels wide
uvwxyz      // 60 pixels wide
There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.

Output: [2,4]

a            // 4 pixels wide

Example 1:

Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

If a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append "ma" to the end of the word.
For example, the word "apple" becomes "applema".
If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end, and so on.
Return the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin.

Input: sentence = "I speak Goat Latin"

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
