        /*You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams, and delete words[i] from words. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "dacb" is an anagram of "abdc".



Example 1:

Input: words = ["abba","baba","bbaa","cd","cd"]
Output: ["abba","cd"]
Explanation:
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = "bbaa" and words[1] = "baba" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
Now words = ["abba","baba","cd","cd"].
- Since words[1] = "baba" and words[0] = "abba" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
Now words = ["abba","cd","cd"].
- Since words[2] = "cd" and words[1] = "cd" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
Now words = ["abba","cd"].
We can no longer perform any operations, so ["abba","cd"] is the final answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","d","e"]
Output: ["a","b","c","d","e"]
Explanation:
No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.*/

Example 1:

Input: s = "lEeTcOdE"

Explanation:
The letter 'E' is the only letter to appear in both lower and upper case.
Example 2:

Input: s = "arRAzFif"

Explanation:
The letter 'R' is the greatest letter to appear in both lower and upper case.
Note that 'A' and 'F' also appear in both lower and upper case, but 'R' is greater than 'F' or 'A'.
Example 3:

Increment all the cells on row ri.

Example 1:

Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].

Tax is calculated as follows:

The first upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent0.
The next upper1 - upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent1.
The next upper2 - upper1 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent2.
And so on.
You are given an integer income representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.



Example 1:

Input: brackets = [[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], income = 10
Output: 2.65000
Explanation:
Based on your income, you have 3 dollars in the 1st tax bracket, 4 dollars in the 2nd tax bracket, and 3 dollars in the 3rd tax bracket.
The tax rate for the three tax brackets is 50%, 10%, and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $3 * 50% + $4 * 10% + $3 * 25% = $2.65 in taxes.
Example 2:

Input: brackets = [[1,0],[4,25],[5,50]], income = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation:
Based on your income, you have 1 dollar in the 1st tax bracket and 1 dollar in the 2nd tax bracket.
The tax rate for the two tax brackets is 0% and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $1 * 0% + $1 * 25% = $0.25 in taxes.
Example 3:

Input: brackets = [[2,50]], income = 0
Output: 0.00000
Explanation:

For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].

For nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].
